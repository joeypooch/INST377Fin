Description:
I used the sportsdata.io MLB API for my website (https://sportsdata.io/developers/api-documentation/mlb) which provided
comprehensive statsistical data on the MLB, different teams and players. 

What visualisations does your project drive?
The main visualizations my project drives is a table that displays relevants stats to the math the project covers and a graph that correlates Wins and Run Differential, crucial to the premise of Moneyball
What visualisation or other JS libraries does your project use?
For visualization, I used bootstrap for formatting, and d3.js for graph creation.

What CSS frameworks did you use? What version of them?
I used Bootstrap 4.5.0
What is your actual project trying to display and solve?
My project is trying to display how moneyball works and to be both an educational and explorational site, but also be a tool in solving problems for baseball teams. They can get a bead
on how their team might do this year, see what the weaknesses are, and make moves to correct them.
